%%%%%%%%% Same amount of work %%%%%%%%%

This is the main() function starting.
the main() function now calling pthread_create().
This is the main() function after pthread_create()
main() starting doing some work.
the_thread_func() starting doing some work.

Result of work in the_thread_func(): sum = 99.999998
Result of work in main(): sum = 99.999998
the main() function now calling pthread_join().

real    0m4,191s
user    0m8,367s
sys     0m0,007s


We can see that real time is roughly half of user time



%%%%%%%%% thread has more work %%%%%%%%%

This is the main() function starting.
the main() function now calling pthread_create().
This is the main() function after pthread_create()
main() starting doing some work.
the_thread_func() starting doing some work.

Result of work in main(): sum = 99.999998
the main() function now calling pthread_join().
Result of work in the_thread_func(): sum = 199.999992

real    0m8,368s
user    0m12,558s
sys     0m0,018s




%%%%%%%%% 3 threads %%%%%%%%%

main and the 2 threads all do the same calculations

This is the main() function starting.
the main() function now calling pthread_create().
the_thread_func() starting doing some work.
This is the main() function after pthread_create()
main() starting doing some work.
the_thread_func_b() starting doing some work.
Result of work in the_thread_func(): sum = 99.999998
Result of work in the_thread_func_b(): sum = 99.999998
Result of work in main(): sum = 99.999998
the main() function now calling pthread_join() on the first thread.
the main() function now calling pthread_join() on the second (b) thread.

real    0m4,216s
user    0m12,579s
sys     0m0,012s

3 threads give real time roughly a third of user time.
