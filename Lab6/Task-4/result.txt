%%%%%%%%%%% Default performance %%%%%%%%%%% 

transform_std tests took   0.957 wall seconds.
transform_opt tests took   0.946 wall seconds.




%%%%%%%%%%% Adding restrict keyword %%%%%%%%%%% 

transform_std tests took   0.962 wall seconds.
transform_opt tests took   0.536 wall seconds.

Big increase when using the restrict keyword




%%%%%%%%%%%  Change the j loop limit from np to NP %%%%%%%%%%% 
transform_std tests took   0.963 wall seconds.
transform_opt tests took   0.566 wall seconds.

No real effect on the performance




%%%%%%%%%%%  change int NP   to   const int NP %%%%%%%%%%% 
transform_std tests took   0.957 wall seconds.
transform_opt tests took   0.109 wall seconds.

Big increase in performance





%%%%%%%%%%%  int NP = 2 inside the transform_opt function %%%%%%%%%%% 

without const keyword:
    transform_std tests took   0.952 wall seconds.
    transform_opt tests took   0.108 wall seconds.

with const keyword:
    transform_std tests took   0.958 wall seconds.
    transform_opt tests took   0.109 wall seconds.


No real change?
