%%%%%%%%%%%%% Default code %%%%%%%%%%%%%
f_std tests took   1.543 wall seconds.
f_opt tests took   1.545 wall seconds.




%%%%%%%%%%%%% My own unrolling %%%%%%%%%%%%%

Remove if statement and do 4 calculations per loop.
At end of loop increment x

f_std tests took   1.547 wall seconds.
f_opt tests took   0.845 wall seconds.





%%%%%%%%%%%%% Unrolling with compiler %%%%%%%%%%%%%

Compile with (-O2 -funroll-loops)
    f_std tests took   1.650 wall seconds.
    f_opt tests took   0.876 wall seconds.  


Compile with (-O3 -funroll-loops) 
    f_std tests took   1.619 wall seconds.
    f_opt tests took   0.883 wall seconds. 


We would expect to see improvment in f_std version if there is any improvment.
f_opt is the same as before (my own unrolling function)

We see no improvment. The reason for that is probably because the code is too complicated
for the compiler to realize that unrolling is possible.
