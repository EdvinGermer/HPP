a[i] are randomly distributed between 0 and 1

f_std tests took   1.548 wall seconds.
f_opt tests took   1.848 wall seconds.
Checking correctness: abs_diff =        0
OK, result seems correct.

f_std tests took   0.751 wall seconds.
f_opt tests took   0.764 wall seconds.

The code runs twice as fast when the two if statements are never entered and
branch prediction can be used.



When I completely removed the if statements in the previous task I got the following:
    f_opt tests took   0.250 wall seconds.

So the best option is still to remove the if statements.
